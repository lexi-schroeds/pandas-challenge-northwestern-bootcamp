    "    a.\tSchools and students within the district\n",
    "    b.\tTotal district budget\n",
    "    c.\tAverage math and reading scores\n",
    "    d.\tPercentage passing math, reading, and overall \n",
    "2.\tSchool Summary; similar to the district summary utilizes all the same data points, but by each individual high school (Bailey, Cabrera, Ford, etc.) \n",
    "3.\tHighest & Lowest Performing School Summaries; which showcases the top schools in the district as well as the lowest schools in the district based on percentage of students passing overall (i.e., both reading and math >= 70)\n",
    "4.\tMath, Reading, and Overall Scores by Grade Summaries; which shows the individual schools average math and reading scores, as well as percentage of students passing math, reading, and overall for each grade (9th to 12th) \n",
    "5.\tScores by School Spending, School Size, and School Type Summaries; which cuts the data to showcase how the spending, size, and type (i.e., district or charter) may impact the average grades and passing percentage of each school \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the available data, you can make some comparisons: \n",
    "1.\tLooking at school spending compared to average grades, you’ll notice that while it may be assumed school that spend more will result in better grades, in fact those schools who are spending <$585 per student see higher passing rates (~90.4%) to those spending $645-$680 (~53.5%)\n",
    "2.\tInstead, it’s more likely that the size of the school or the type of school has a higher impact than spending; as small (<1000 total students) and medium sized (1000-2000 total students) schools tend to have better passing rates than large sized schools (>2000 total students)\n",
    "3.\tSimilarly, charter schools tend to have higher passing rates (~90.4%) than district schools  (~53.7%)\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if you’re looking to improve scores and passing rates, rather than increasing budget of schools, it may make more sense to open more charter schools in order to lessen the amount of students in a single school and thereby increase the amount of small or medium-sized schools. \n",
